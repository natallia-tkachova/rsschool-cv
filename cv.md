It was a very useful experience, but I don’t stop there, so I continue to study and improve my knowledge in both JavaScript and English

## Code Example
```
function getCount(str) {
  let vowelsCount = 0;
  const vowels = ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u'];

    if (vowels.includes(str[i])) {
      vowelsCount++;
    }
  }
  return vowelsCount;
}
```
